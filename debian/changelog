    - Added ignition plugins when gazebo=ignition
    - Adjusted front caster position to better align with the create3 model
    - Adjusted wheeldrop spring stiffness to compensate for the front caster position change
    * Launch joint_state_publisher and diffdrive_controller only in classic
    * Use joint_state_publisher for both ignition and classic

    Adjusted front caster position
    * Simulation -> simulator
    * Added irobot_create_ignition packages
    * Fixed some linter warnings
    * Removed joint state publisher from ros_ign_bridge

    Created new README.md for irobot_create_ignition
    * Update README.md
    * Added ignition edifice repos for source installation
